"A narrow stone hallway extends into the dim light ahead.
Cold drafts slip through cracks in the walls, carrying a faint smell of rust.
Empty torch brackets cling to the stone, casting long, uneven shadows.
Broken chains and scattered debris litter the floor.
further to the NORTH, there is a half open cell door that leads to a stairway that goes up."
